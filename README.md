# Surfs_up
We'll be using Jupyter Notebook and VS Code as well as flask functionality

## Overview of Project

W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

### Purpose
1. Determine the Summary Statistics for June
2. Determine the Summary Statistics for December
3. A written report for the statistical analysis

## Resources

* Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.50.1, Jupyter Notebook, Flask, SQLalchemy dependency

## Summary
* Based on the data the ice cream shop should be able to thrive on the temperature information alone.  The average high is consistent over both months, while both months show evidence to be able to sustain demand for being warm enough.  Moreover the evidence shows that average hours of sunlight and amount of precipitation woud only enhance the sustainability analysis and provides a green light for year-round business at this location.
* The mean temperature differences between December and June are likely not as disparate as in other parts of the nation. The difference in mean peak temperature between June, at 75°, and December, at 71°, is a mere 4°. Comparatively, the average high temperature in LA is 78° in June while in December its 68°.
* Max temperature observed in each month is more or less the same, 85° in June while 83° in December. Standard deviation with all these data points suggest that the opportunities for ice cream along with surfing will be consistent througout the whole year.
* Alhtough temperature is noticeably lower in December than in June, daytime temperatures are forecast to allow for surfing and ice cream.  The lower nighttime temperatures create the opportunity to sell something warm such as tea or coffee along with warm desserts.

## Challenge Overview
* I enjoyed the challenge of using Flask and sql alchemy.  Found SQLite to be very useful tool to stage a Postgres or Mysql deployment.
* It was interesting creating an SQLite database for my weather API using Pandas & SQLAlchemy and the CSV files provided to create my SQLite database.
* I found it intriguing to create my weather API to do a climate analysis on data stored in the SQLite database previously created. Data was analyzed using SQLAlchemy to perform queries of data which was invaluable experience received.
* The very last and most interesting step was to create a Flask app to power the weather API.
